-Google has security feature checks
- SO How do malicious browsers get into the Chrome store?
  -evasion tactics, bypassing security checks
    -multi-script files that work together. The malware is split up between different files so that each file might not seem like it has malicious tendencies, and it may look clean. But in reality it works with other files to perform malicious attacks
    -using hex to encode strings in the javascript content content (show sample)
    -using HTTPs and a known, good domain to host malicious JavaScript like heroku app. This gives it the appearance of a legitimate extension
    -using fake file extensions

- The ins and outs of browser plugins
  -manifest
  -background.js
    -able to prevent the removal of the malicious plugin by closing the chrome tab to       manage your extensions
    -you can manipulate it to prevent access to anti virus websites
  -removes the security option from HTTP response header. This would typically stop cross-site scripting attacks
  - runs javascript in the background. What kind of control do they have over you? they can screen scrape, read form fill data (username, passwords, etc), can control social media account (follow, like, subscribe, unsubscribe, friend request)
