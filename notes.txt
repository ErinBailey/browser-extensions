Good morning! My name is Erin and I want to talk about browser extensions from both a technical and nontechnical perspective. Specifically from the standpoint of a developer with an emphasis on security. 

- What is an extension? 
  -Browser extensions can be referred to by many different names, If you're using chrome or safari, it IS called an extension, if you're using firefox it's a plugin, and if you're using internet explorer, you probably actually don't care about security. Which is fine! It's good that you're here 
  (IE addresses bugs on a fixed schedule, despite the fact that they are not discovered every 3rd wednesday of the month. They're also slow to address these bugs, and they don't check for outdated extensions) 
  But whatever you want to call them, they are programs that adds bits of functionality to your browser. you install them instantly without needing to restart your browswer, and they update
    silently when new versions are available. 
    They are implemented with standard web technologies. HTML, Css, Javascript, etc.

-Components of an extension
  So What's in an extension? What is the anatomy of an extension? extensions have a compressed directory with a bunch of files. It needs a manifest.json 
  which contains meta data about the extension, lists permissions, and points to the extensions other Components
  The components that it points to are what is going to provide functionality like browser actions or page actions, running scripts like grabbing form fill data or 
  closing and opening tabs based off events.

  Although they are meant to be convenient and helpful to users, much like everything in this world, that gets ruined by people who have malicious intentions. Extensions have quite a bit of power, 
  once they're installed they can grab all form your fill data you enter, including sensitive information like usernames, passwords, creditcard information, addresses, etc. They can control what websites you can or cannot visit, they 
  close tabs out without your permission, and they can essentially read and change everything you see on webpages.

-Google has security feature checks
  Before extensions are approved for use in the chrome store, they must go through security checks
  - blocking anything attempting to reach out to a filesystem
  - A sample of what is shown when you create an extension
  - blocking any extensions not hosted on chrome's web store
    in 2015 when they implemented this rule, they said they saw a 75% in support requests for uninstalling unwanted extensions when it made this policy official for Windows users
  - Vetting process


- SO How do malicious browsers get into the Chrome store?
    - Spoofing .
    The developers who are out to capture your data and use it for their own gain rely on the reputation of legitimate products that are wildly popular in the community. For example, in 2015 there was an extensions added to the chrome store called "AdBlocker". 
    For those of you familiar with AdBlock Plus, More than 10 million people use that service! The developers of the fake AdBlocker posed as this credible and reputable team with a similar logo, and 
    they developers managed to convince 37,000 people to download it. Which is pretty significant considering they go through a fairly extensive security proces.
    They responded to the reports of the extension being fake within a few hours, but there is some questions on how it got there in the first place. 
    Along with spoofing, there are tactics such as 
    - multi-script files that work together. The malware is split up between different files so that each file might not seem like it has malicious tendencies, and it may look clean. But in reality it works with other files to perform malicious attacks
    - using hex to encode strings in the javascript content content (show sample)
    - using HTTPs and a known, good domain to host malicious JavaScript like heroku app. This gives it the appearance of a legitimate extension
    - using fake file extensions


- The ins and outs of browser plugins
  - manifest
  - background.js
    - able to prevent the removal of the malicious plugin by closing the chrome tab to       manage your extensions
    - you can manipulate it to prevent access to anti virus websites
  - removes the security option from HTTP response header. This would typically stop cross-site scripting attacks
  - runs javascript in the background. What kind of control do they have over you? they can screen scrape, read form fill data (username, passwords, etc), can control social media account (follow, like, subscribe, unsubscribe, friend request)


- How can you protect yourself?
  - strongly advise users to avoid clicking links from messages
  - make sure the extension comes from a legitimate source
  - "That presents an especially tricky situation for users who might not carefully check each extensionâ€™s developer."

-Thanks!
  The reason I chose to reasearch this topic from the point of a negative use
  was because I think that as developers, security is often overlooked which can leave a program very vulnerable, and eventually it can leave the user very vulnerable! I think that it strengthens our skills to then go the opposite direction down the happy path and think "Okay, how can I prevent that from happening"
  Anow now I'm going to show you the world's most uninspiring live demo.
